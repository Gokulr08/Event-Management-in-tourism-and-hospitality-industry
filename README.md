# Event Management in Tourism and Hospitality Project

During my final year, I wanted to stand out by doing a unique project. Most of my classmates were working on simple HTML pages, but I aimed to do something special. After some thought, I decided on an event management project in the tourism and hospitality industry. Organizing events is challenging and time-consuming, so I wanted to create a solution.

I'm a fan of Python, so I decided to go all-in on it. I researched ways to build an end-to-end webpage using Python and discovered Django, a framework that could help. I learned Django and MySQL to understand how websites connect to databases.

## Project Highlights:

- Users can log in to view events on the homepage, including event type, venue location, and ticket prices.
- If users want to join an event, they can easily book a ticket by providing their name, number, and quantity.
- Instead of a payment API, I opted to display a payment success message using a simple form.
- Users can also register their own events, like birthday parties or family reunions. Our team receives the information and contacts them via email for further details.
- Beyond organizing events, I emphasized customer care because hospitality is essential.

## Technologies Used:

- **Backend:** Python, Django, MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
